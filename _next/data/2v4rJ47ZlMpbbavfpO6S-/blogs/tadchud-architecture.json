I want to explain why we decide to use each tools. Some of them you might not hear about, do not use it, or never implement on your projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"techology-stack\">Techology stack</h2>\n<h3 id=\"frameworks\">Frameworks</h3>\n<div>\n<img src=\"/blogs-assets/nextjs.svg\" style=\"width: 90px; height: 90px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Next.js(React)</p>\n</div>\nActually we don't need server side rendering but we're lazy people to use React Router. So Next.js is the best solution to automatically generate routes. That's it~~. \n<br/>\nWe decided to use two UI libraries\n<li>Chakra-UI</li> \n<li>Mantine-UI</li>\n\n<br/>\n\n<div>\n<img src=\"/blogs-assets/graphql.png\" style=\"width: 90px; height: 90px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Graphql</p>\n</div>\nIt's a Query language for API that we can select specifically fields that we need and it has only one endpoint. In contrast REST API has over-fetching, under-fetching, and multiple endpoints to get all data.\n\n<p><em>Sample Graphql query</em></p>\n<pre>\n{\n  product {\n    name\n    height\n    variants\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n\n<br/>\n\n<div>\n<img src=\"/blogs-assets/fastify.png\" style=\"width: 90px; height: 90px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Fastify</p>\n</div>\nAlmost the same as ExpressJS but better ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž. Well, there is no everything perfect, so we made some internal plugins to fix some issues from fastify and more compatiable with Graphql.\nFastify also faster than others Nodejs frameworks that we know.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<h3 id=\"databases\">Databases</h3>\n<div>\n<img src=\"/blogs-assets/postgresql.png\" style=\"width: 90px; height: 90px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">PostgreSQL</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>We decide to use PostgreSQL because it&#39;s a popular and powerful object-relational database. And we have experienced to use in many projects(Small and Medium sizes). it has good performance and comprehensively support unstructured data eg. JSON, JSONB which we have to use to store customization data because we still don&#39;t have much experience with 3D/2D customization tool so we&#39;re not sure how many fields and what data type of each so unstructured data is very suitable.\n<br/></p>\n<div>\n<img src=\"/blogs-assets/typesense.png\" style=\"width: 90px; height: 90px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Typesense Search engine</p>\n</div>\nYou might hear or use Elasticsearch, Agolia, Apache solr which are very popular and many companies use them. As you know we are Tech enthusiasts persons so we're looking forward to new tools that we never use before. As we have been tried Typesense, it very powerful, and easy to implement and set up. We hopefully will not change to others later. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£\n<br/>\n\n<div>\n<img src=\"/blogs-assets/redis.png\" style=\"width: 90px; height: 90px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Redis</p>\n</div>\nOf course your guessing is right. Redis is a in-memory database for caching data to prevent our PostgreSQL database get hurt from every request. Keeps the dataset in memory for fast access, but can also persist all writes to permanent. We also implement it on top of Event driven architecture as publisher and subscriber engine to communicate internal services.\n\n<h3 id=\"other-tools\">Other tools</h3>\n<li>Docker</li>\n<li>Kubernetes</li>\n<li>Linode Cloud provider</li>\n<li>Nginx</li>\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<h2 id=\"architecture\">Architecture</h2>\n<img src=\"/blogs-assets/architecture.png\" style=\"width: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/author/tar.jpeg"},"coverImage":"/blogs-assets/logo/technology-stack.svg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
